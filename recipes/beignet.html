    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These New Orleans-Style Beignets will be the best treat you've ever had, and the best part is you can make them at home!</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups warm water, between 110 and 115 degrees (F)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>15 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 cups peanut oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>2 cups confectionersâ€™ sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-size bowl, add the warm water, sugar, and yeast and whisk well to combine. Sit aside for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture has bubbled up and become foamy.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,  beat the eggs until smooth. Beat in the vanilla and evaporated milk. Beat in 3 and 1/2 cups of the flour until smooth. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly pour in the yeast mixture (careful here - this mixture can splash up if added to quickly!); beat until smooth. Add in the butter and beat until incorporated. Finally, beat in the remaining 3 and 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Beat until dough is smooth and cohesive; about 2 minutes. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Line a large rimmed baking sheet with three layers of paper towels, set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large enameled cast-iron pan, heat 4-inches of oil to 360 degrees (F). Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut the dough into 2 and 1/2-inch squares.</li>
        <li>In batches, fry the dough until they puff up and are golden brown in color, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beignets to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and serve at once!</li>
    </ol>
